# Protocol and encrypted model changes

## Unreleased

- Client Dev (2026-10-03, client-only encrypted payloads): add the independent
  `rdp_host` object kind under the Inventory KEK, with host identity/group/tags,
  an explicit password-credential reference, domain and desktop dimensions.
  It is deliberately not a new optional flag on `host`: older clients skip
  unknown encrypted object kinds and retain their ciphertext, instead of
  treating an RDP endpoint as SSH or dropping its settings when re-saving.
  Existing SSH bytes, server DTOs, encryption format and wire version are
  unchanged. Clipboard/folder permissions and certificate decisions are local
  session state and never part of the synced object. RDP sharing is not enabled
  by this model addition.
